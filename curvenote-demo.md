# Introduction
The study of penguin species provides key insights into the ecological adaptations of seabirds to diverse environments. The Palmer Penguins dataset [](doi:10.32614/RJ-2022-020), featuring three species from the Palmer Archipelago (see [](#Figure1)), has become a benchmark dataset for exploring biological trends in bill morphology, flipper length, and body mass. Here, we aim to investigate the differences in body mass across species and sexes to understand how sexual dimorphism and ecological pressures shape these traits. By using statistical and visualization techniques, we provide a concise analysis while showcasing the utility of Curvenote for creating dynamic, reproducible scientific documents.

# Methods

We analyzed the Palmer Penguins dataset, which includes data on three penguin species (Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo). The dataset was preprocessed to remove missing values, and body mass was grouped by species and sex. Mean body mass and the standard deviation of the mean (STD) were computed for each group (see [](#Figure2)). Visualizations were created using Python and Matplotlib, with error bars to represent variability. All analyses and figures were dynamically integrated into the manuscript using Curvenote.
